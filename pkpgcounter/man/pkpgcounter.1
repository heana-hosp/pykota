.PP
pkpgcounter is a generic Page Description Language parser.
.PP
pkpgcounter parses any number of input files and/or its standard input
and outputs the number of pages needed to print these documents.
.PP
pkpgcounter can also compute the percent of ink coverage in different
colorspaces for several file formats.
.PP
pkpgcounter currently recognizes the following document formats :
.IP
* PostScript (both DSC compliant and binary)
* PDF
* PCLXL (aka PCL6)
* PCL3/4/5
* DVI
* OpenDocument (ISO/IEC DIS 26300)
* Microsoft Word (c) (tm) (r) (etc...)
* Plain text
* TIFF
* Several other image formats
* ESC/P2
* Zenographics ZjStream
* Samsung QPDL (aka SPL2)
* Samsung SPL1
* ESC/PageS03
* Brother HBP
* Hewlett\-Packard LIDIL (hpijs)
* Structured Fax
* Canon BJ/BJC
* ASCII PNM (Netpbm)
.PP
The ten latter ones, as well as some TIFF documents, are currently
only supported in page counting mode.
.PP
command line usage :
.IP
pkpgcounter [options] [files]
.PP
options :
.TP
\fB\-v\fR | \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints pkpgcounter's version number then exits.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR | \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints this message then exits.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR | \fB\-\-debug\fR
Activate debug mode.
.TP
\fB\-cCOLORSPACE\fR, \fB\-\-colorspace\fR=\fICOLORSPACE\fR
Activate the computation of ink usage, and defines the
colorspace to use. Supported values are 'BW' (Black),
\&'RGB', 'CMYK', 'CMY', and 'GC' (Grayscale vs Color).
\&'GC' is useful if you only need to differentiate
grayscale pages from coloured pages but don't care
about ink usage per se.
.TP
\fB\-rRESOLUTION\fR, \fB\-\-resolution\fR=\fIRESOLUTION\fR
The resolution in DPI to use when checking ink usage.
Lower resolution is faster but less accurate. Default
is 72 dpi.
.PP
examples :
.IP
\f(CW$ pkpgcounter file1.ps file2.escp2 file3.pclxl <file4.pcl345\fR
.IP
Will launch pkpgcounter and will output the total number of pages
needed to print all the documents specified.
.IP
\f(CW$ pkpgcounter \-\-colorspace bw \-\-resolution 150 file1.ps\fR
.IP
Will output the percent of black ink needed on each page of
the file1.ps file rendered at 150 dpi.
