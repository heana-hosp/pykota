# pykota
Git Repository to Pykota

This repository was created to update the pykota project and adapt it to Python version 3.10.

### Features
 - Updated the version to work with python version 3.10 or higher;

### Considerations
 - This version was tested only on Postgres Database;
 - We adapt in order to meet personal demands;
 - Only the pkipplib, pkpgcounter and pykota projects have been migrated to version 3.10 or higher;
 - The tea4cups project have not migrated at the moment and we don't know if we will update. The pykotaicon project will be updated soon.
