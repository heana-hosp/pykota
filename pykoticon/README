====================================================================

PyKotIcon is a cross-platform client-side helper for PyKota.

It is meant to be launched whenever the user logs in, and stay in 
the taskbar (depending on the client operating system) until the 
user closes his session. 
  
Installation :

  * GNU/Linux and similar :
  
    $ cd pykoticon
    $ python setup.py install
    
    Then modify your .xsession file, or the appropriate file depending
    on your desktop environment, to ensure that the pykoticon command
    is launched in the background each time your X Window session
    starts.
    
    You MUST pass the list of hostnames or IP addresses from which
    PyKotIcon should accept incoming connexions on pykoticon's
    command line. Connexions from localhost are always accepted.
    If you use PyKotIcon with PyKota, you'll want to pass the
    hostnames or IP addresses of ALL print servers on pykoticon's
    command line.
    
    NB : `pykoticon --help` will give you hints about the expected
    command line parameters.
    
  * MS Windows :  
  
    Download pykoticon-x.yy.zip from 
    
        http://www.pykota.com/software/pykoticon/download/tarballs/
        
    Unzip it into a directory of its own. I usually unzip it into    
    /var/lib/samba/netlogon/pykoticon/
    
    Modify the PYKOTICON.VBS file to include the list of authorized
    print servers and change other parameters as needed, as explained
    in the GNU/Linux section above.
    
    Ensure that PYKOTICON.VBS is executed each time an user logs
    in. The easiest way to do this is in STARTUP.CMD :
    
      --- CUT ---
      SET PATH=%PATH%;\\MYSERVER\NETLOGON\PYKOTICON\
      \\MYSERVER\NETLOGON\PYKOTICON\PYKOTICON.VBS 
      --- CUT ---
      
    NB : if you launch PYKOTICON.EXE directly instead of from
    PYKOTICON.VBS, a small but disturbing window may appear on 
    the screen.

Usage :

  PyKotIcon is often used as a client side companion of the PyKota
  print accounting solution, with PyKota's pknotify command line tool
  acting as a PyKotIcon client. But in reality PyKotIcon is completely
  independant of PyKota, and can be used from any application
  which can do remote procedure calls over XML-RPC.
  
  PyKotIcon exposes 4 of its methods over XML-RPC, here they are :
  
    - nop :
    
      This methods does exactly nothing :)
      
      - Input : No argument.
      
      - Output : returns the True boolean value.
      
    - quitApplication :  
    
      This method causes the PyKotIcon application to exit.
      
      - Input : No argument.
      
      - Output : returns the True boolean value.
          
    - showDialog :  
   
      This methods displays an informational message, and returns
      the choice the user made, if any.
       
      - Input : 
        
        - message : a Binary XML-RPC object representing an UTF-8 encoded 
          character string which will be displayed to the end user. 
          This string can contain literal "\n" sequences which will 
          be automatically expanded into line breaks by PyKotIcon.
          
        - confirmation : a boolean value indicating if the user will  
          be given the choice to valid or cancel (True), or only
          to valid (False) the dialog box.
            
      - Output :      
      
        - the literal string "OK" if the user clicked on the OK button,
          else the literal string "CANCEL". The latter is only possible
          if the method was called with its second parameter set to
          True.
        
    - askDatas :      
    
      This method can generate an input form and return what the user
      entered in the different fields.
      
      - Input :
      
        - An array of labels, one label per input field in the 
          form to be created. Each label in the list is passed as
          a Binary XML-RPC object representing an UTF-8 encoded
          character string.
          
        - An array of variables names, one name per input field in
          the form to be created. Each name in the list is passed
          as an ASCII encoded character string.
          
        - An array of initial values, one possibly empty value per  
          input field in the form to be created. Each initial value
          in the list is passed as a Binary XML-RPC object representing
          an UTF-8 encoded character string.
      
      - Output :
      
        - An associative array (e.g. Python mapping) containing the
          variables names as keys and the variables' contents as
          values in the following format :
          
          - Each key is an ASCII encoded character string representing
            the name of a variable to ask which was passed from the 
            caller.
            
          - Each value is a Binary XML-RPC object representing an UTF-8  
            encoded character string, itself being the result of user
            input in the form's field for this particular variable.

          - A special key named 'isValid' gives access to a boolean
            value in the associative array. If the value is True,
            then the input fields' contents are valid. If the value
            is False, then was the user typed in the input fields
            has to be discarded because, for example, the user
            closed the form without validing his entries.
            In this case, all the other values are empty strings
            anyway.
            
            
IMPORTANT : PyKotIcon doesn't currently support encrypted connexions,            
so if you're afraid of sensitive information flying in the clear
over the nework, you should probably install a transparent secure 
tunneling software like stunnel on both sides of each connection.
