PyKotIcon NEWS :

  - 1.02 (2006-06-07) :
    
    - Added the --cache command line option to specify the time in
      seconds during which input forms' content will be cached.
      This allows people to avoid retyping their username and
      password for each print job, for example.
      
    - Doesn't display the Quit menu anymore if not allowed.
    
    - Doesn't display the ugly traceback anymore when the client  
      disconnects before the server has sent the answer back
      (pknotify --timeout).
      
  - 1.01 (2006-05-01) :
      
    - Now accepts command line options.    
    
    - Less ugly when run under *nix.
    
    - Debug mode off by default.
    
  - 1.00 (2006-03-23) : 
  
    - First release
